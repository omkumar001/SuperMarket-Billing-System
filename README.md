# SuperMarket-Billing-System
It is our third semester OOPS Project implemented in JAVA . It is a billing platform which enables both the customer as well as the shop owner to maintain and carry on their transaction on this platform.


To make the system hassle free and time efficient , we thought of a solution
that could make the system fast, smooth and transparent. So, we came up
with this idea of the “Smart Billing Software”. It helps in


- Saving in labor due to self-service system.
- Low cost of operation.
- Freedom of selection.
- Shopping is very easy and quick
