# How the idea came in our mind !
Lack of the systematic billing system .Many of the shops don’t have a proper and organized billing system which sometimes result in the tedious task of manual bill calculation leading to the waste of time and resources. Due to this there are chances of ambiguitybetween customer and shopkeeper related to the bill.

# SuperMarket-Billing-System
It is our third semester OOPS Project implemented in JAVA . It is a billing platform which enables both the customer as well as the shop owner to maintain and carry on their transaction on this platform.

To make the system hassle free and time efficient , we thought of a solution that could make the system fast, smooth and transparent. So, we came up with this idea of the “Smart Billing Software”. It helps in


- Saving in labor due to self-service system.
- Low cost of operation.
- Freedom of selection.
- Shopping is very easy and quick


# Key Features of OOPS implemented :

The code has been done for calculating and storing the bill per customer and it is accessible by the staff of the shop also .


**Inheritence :**

In this project , we have implemented the inheritance by inherting the features of the Billing System (SuperClass) using the Staff_emp and Customer class (Subclasses).

**Polymorphism :**

Here ,we tried to implement this features by implementing the Operation (interface) in the Billing_System (Superclass) since it’s an abstract class and the two (subclasses) Staff_emp and Customer class are using the features of the interface in their own way.

**Abstraction :**

We have used this feature in our code by creating an array of object in the (subclasses) for each item without knowing the inside details of the item object. And we also have used some of the behaviours of the object without knowing the actual implementation of those.

**Encapsulation:**

This feature has been implemented by the creation of the objects of the superclass and using their features.
