# How the idea came in our mind !
Lack of the systematic billing system .Many of the shops don’t have a proper and organized billing system which sometimes result in the tedious task of manual bill calculation leading to the waste of time and resources. Due to this there are chances of ambiguitybetween customer and shopkeeper related to the bill.

# SuperMarket-Billing-System
It is our third semester OOPS Project implemented in JAVA . It is a billing platform which enables both the customer as well as the shop owner to maintain and carry on their transaction on this platform.

To make the system hassle free and time efficient , we thought of a solution that could make the system fast, smooth and transparent. So, we came up with this idea of the “Smart Billing Software”. It helps in


- Saving in labor due to self-service system.
- Low cost of operation.
- Freedom of selection.
- Shopping is very easy and quick
